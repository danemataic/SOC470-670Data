115934,US,"Despite this being aged in new Russian oak, this Chardonnay is light bodied and oddly floral.

116925,US,"Tangerine and orange zest aromas are overcome by a peppery and stemmy quality.

116937,US,"Slightly dusty, but piquant aromas of freshly pressed apple cider are pleasant in this fairly dry Michigan Riesling.

Iijima,,Peninsula 2010 Dry Riesling (Old Mission Peninsula),Riesling,Peninsula
116947,US,"While floral notes waver a bit chemically on the nose, the palate on this Michigan Riesling is nicely concentrated, with abundant fresh apple and citrus flavors. Just slightly off-dry in style, it finishes sprightly with cut and focus.",Block II,84,25,Michigan,Old Mission Peninsula,,Anna Lee C. Iijima,,Bowers Harbor 2010 Block II Riesling (Old Mission Peninsula),Riesling,Bowers Harbor

The finish comes with a hint of tobacco and a minerally tang.",Estates,85,31,Missouri,Missouri,,,,Mount Pleasant Winery 2009 Estates Norton (Missouri),Norton,Mount Pleasant Winery
121770,US,"This is an interesting variety choice for Michigan, yet it seems to show some typicity. Muddled stone fruit meets yellow plum and milky, white flowers on the nose. The palate is focused on citrus and pineapple rind while showing good overall balance of acidity.",Braganini Reserve,86,15,Michigan,Michigan,,Alexander Peartree,,St. Julian 2013 Braganini Reserve AlbariÃ±o (Michigan),AlbariÃ±o,St. Julian
121875,US,"An acid-driven wine, this has a palpable tartness, with feeble notes of raw wood, blueberry and smoke. Pairing this with a grilled pizza with a layer of tomato sauce could help tame the wild acids.",Jeunette Rouge,81,9,Missouri,Missouri,,,,Les Bourgeois NV Jeunette Rouge Red (Missouri),Red Blend,Les Bourgeois

123570,US,"A blend of 70% Cabernet Franc and 30% Merlot, this feels a little light on flesh, providing little cushion to the high acids.

126646,US,"This is a contemplative blend of Merlot and Sangiovese, the latter being an atypical grape for the region. Using the winery's trademarked Nellaserra greenhouse system, this wine has found warmer-climate ripeness in the cool climes of northern Michigan. Blending characteristics of both grapes, black raspberry, cherry and plum meet savory herb and game tones on the nose and palate. Round in feel and nicely balanced, think of this as a softer, Americanized Super Tuscan.",Bel Tramonto,89,39,Michigan,Old Mission Peninsula,,Alexander Peartree,,Mari 2010 Bel Tramonto Red (Old Mission Peninsula),Red Blend,Mari
127198,US,"A Claret from Missouri? Adventurers should give this wine a shot. On the nose, it's delicate and filled with floral and soft, spicy notes. The flavors are somewhat thin and wan thoughâ€”red berry, pepper, tobaccoâ€”and the wine finishes with a slightly bitter edge. Pair with with barbecueâ€”it might fare better.",Claret,82,15,Missouri,Missouri,,Susan Kostrzewa,@suskostrzewa,Mount Pleasant Winery 2006 Claret Red (Missouri),Red Blend,Mount Pleasant Winery
127936,US,"Ambitious and concentrated, with an inky color and a juicy, mouthwatering palate framed by mature blackberry and raspberry fruit. A pronounced char note on the nose follows through to a medium, slightly tart finish. Try with barbecued pork belly. Already showing signs of earthy maturity, this wine is unlikely to benefit from further aging though the firm acid will allow it to keep another year or two.",,86,35,Missouri,Missouri,,,,Mount Pleasant Winery 2006 Norton (Missouri),Norton,Mount Pleasant Winery
127966,US,"Light ruby in color, 50% of this bottling sees 10 months in new French oak. Juicy cranberry and floral strawberry meet peppery spice on the round palate.
